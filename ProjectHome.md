# Introduction #

## Background ##

Lua is a great dynamic programming language, Adobe Flash is a great universal platform for applications and Adobe Alchemy is the tool to bind them together.

A demo can be found here:
http://lua-alchemy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo/index.html

Another demo: port of !EZPlatformer game example from popular flixel framework (http://flixel.org):

### Lua ###

> _Lua is a powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language._

> _Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping._

### Adobe Flash ###

> _Adobe Flash (previously called "Macromedia Flash"') is a set of multimedia software created by Macromedia and currently developed and distributed by Adobe Systems. Since its introduction in 1996, Flash has become a popular method for adding animation and interactivity to web pages; Flash is commonly used to create animation, advertisements, and various web page components, to integrate video into web pages, and more recently, to develop rich Internet applications._

### Adobe Alchemy ###

> _With Alchemy, Web application developers can now reuse hundreds of millions of lines of existing open source C and C++ client or server-side code on the Flash Platform.  Alchemy brings the power of high performance C and C++ libraries to Web applications with minimal degradation on AVM2.  The C/C++ code is compiled to ActionScript 3.0 as a SWF or SWC that runs on Adobe Flash Player 10 or Adobe AIR 1.5._

## Motivation ##

We need **Lua Alchemy** to...

  * ...To use **run-time dynamic** programming language (Lua) within the Flash framework.
  * ...To **reuse** existing Lua code for the Flash-based utilities
  * ...To get a **great cross-platform back-end** (Flash) for (simpler) Lua-based games
  * ...To have fun with **awesome cool** technology :-)
