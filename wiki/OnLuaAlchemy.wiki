= Introduction =

== Background ==

Lua is a great dynamic programming language, Adobe Flash is a great universal platform for applications and Adobe Alchemy is the tool to bind them together.

=== Lua ===

    _Lua is a powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language._

    _Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping._

=== Adobe Flash ===

    _Adobe Flash (previously called "Macromedia Flash"') is a set of multimedia software created by Macromedia and currently developed and distributed by Adobe Systems. Since its introduction in 1996, Flash has become a popular method for adding animation and interactivity to web pages; Flash is commonly used to create animation, advertisements, and various web page components, to integrate video into web pages, and more recently, to develop rich Internet applications._

=== Adobe Alchemy ===

    _With Alchemy, Web application developers can now reuse hundreds of millions of lines of existing open source C and C++ client or server-side code on the Flash Platform.  Alchemy brings the power of high performance C and C++ libraries to Web applications with minimal degradation on AVM2.  The C/C++ code is compiled to ActionScript 3.0 as a SWF or SWC that runs on Adobe Flash Player 10 or Adobe AIR 1.5._

== Motivation ==

We need *Lua Alchemy* to...

  * ...To use *run-time dynamic* programming language (Lua) within the Flash framework. 
  * ...To *reuse* existing Lua code for the Flash-based utilities
  * ...To get a *great cross-platform back-end* (Flash) for (simpler) Lua-based games
  * ...To have fun with *awesome* new technology :-)

= Organization =

== Sites ==

  * Main place for *collaboration*: *[http://code.google.com/p/lua-alchemy/ GoogleProjects]* (file releases, wiki, issues)
  * Main place for *development*: *[http://github.com/lua-alchemy/lua-alchemy/ GitHub]* (Git source control)
  * Developer's *mailing list*: *[http://groups.google.com/group/lua-alchemy-dev/ GoogleGroups]* (to be made open for public as soon as we're ready)

== License ==

*Lua Achemy* is licensed at the same license as Lua 5.1: the *[http://github.com/lua-alchemy/lua-alchemy/tree/master/COPYRIGHT MIT license]*. This means that Lua Alchemy is *free software* and can be used for both academic and commercial purposes *at absolutely no cost*.

== Development model ==

*TODO:* Write based on [http://groups.google.com/group/lua-alchemy-dev/browse_thread/thread/ad7c66d2c93cc4d3 this] discussion. Put it on LuaAlchemyDevelopmentModel page.
